# docker-josim

This is a container that contains josim, python and other tools.

JoSIM is a SPICE syntax circuit simulator specifically created to handle superconducting elements such as the Josephson junction

Now, circuits containing pi-junctions(ferromagnetic junctions) can also be simulated.
